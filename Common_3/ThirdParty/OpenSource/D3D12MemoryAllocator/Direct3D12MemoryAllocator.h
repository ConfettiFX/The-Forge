\page quick_start Quick start

\section quick_start_project_setup Project setup and initialization

This is a small, standalone C++ library. It consists of a pair of 2 files:
"%D3D12MemAlloc.h" header file with public interface and "D3D12MemAlloc.cpp" with
internal implementation. The only external dependencies are WinAPI, Direct3D 12,
and parts of C/C++ standard library (but STL containers, exceptions, or RTTI are
not used).

The library is developed and tested using Microsoft Visual Studio 2019, but it
should work with other compilers as well. It is designed for 64-bit code.

To use the library in your project:

(1.) Copy files `D3D12MemAlloc.cpp`, `%D3D12MemAlloc.h` to your project.

(2.) Make `D3D12MemAlloc.cpp` compiling as part of the project, as C++ code.

(3.) Include library header in each CPP file that needs to use the library.

\code
#include "D3D12MemAlloc.h"
\endcode

(4.) Right after you created `ID3D12Device`, fill D3D12MA::ALLOCATOR_DESC
structure and call function D3D12MA::CreateAllocator to create the main
D3D12MA::Allocator object.

Please note that all symbols of the library are declared inside #D3D12MA namespace.

\code
IDXGIAdapter* adapter = (...)
ID3D12Device* device = (...)

D3D12MA::ALLOCATOR_DESC allocatorDesc = {};
allocatorDesc.pDevice = device;
allocatorDesc.pAdapter = adapter;

D3D12MA::Allocator* allocator;
HRESULT hr = D3D12MA::CreateAllocator(&allocatorDesc, &allocator);
\endcode

(5.) Right before destroying the D3D12 device, destroy the allocator object.

Please note that objects of this library must be destroyed by calling `Release`
method (despite they are not COM interfaces and no reference counting is involved).

\code
allocator->Release();
\endcode


\section quick_start_creating_resources Creating resources

To use the library for creating resources (textures and buffers), call method
D3D12MA::Allocator::CreateResource in the place where you would previously call
`ID3D12Device::CreateCommittedResource`.

The function has similar syntax, but it expects structure D3D12MA::ALLOCATION_DESC
to be passed along with `D3D12_RESOURCE_DESC` and other parameters for created
resource. This structure describes parameters of the desired memory allocation,
including choice of `D3D12_HEAP_TYPE`.

The function also returns a new object of type D3D12MA::Allocation, created along
with usual `ID3D12Resource`. It represents allocated memory and can be queried
for size, offset, `ID3D12Resource`, and `ID3D12Heap` if needed.

\code
D3D12_RESOURCE_DESC resourceDesc = {};
resourceDesc.Dimension = D3D12_RESOURCE_DIMENSION_TEXTURE2D;
resourceDesc.Alignment = 0;
resourceDesc.Width = 1024;
resourceDesc.Height = 1024;
resourceDesc.DepthOrArraySize = 1;
resourceDesc.MipLevels = 1;
resourceDesc.Format = DXGI_FORMAT_R8G8B8A8_UNORM;
resourceDesc.SampleDesc.Count = 1;
resourceDesc.SampleDesc.Quality = 0;
resourceDesc.Layout = D3D12_TEXTURE_LAYOUT_UNKNOWN;
resourceDesc.Flags = D3D12_RESOURCE_FLAG_NONE;

D3D12MA::ALLOCATION_DESC allocationDesc = {};
allocDesc.HeapType = D3D12_HEAP_TYPE_DEFAULT;

D3D12Resource* resource;
D3D12MA::Allocation* allocation;
HRESULT hr = allocator->CreateResource(
	&allocationDesc,
	&resourceDesc,
	D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_COPY_DEST,
	NULL,
	&allocation,
	IID_PPV_ARGS(&resource));
\endcode

You need to remember both resource and allocation objects and destroy them
separately when no longer needed.

\code
allocation->Release();
resource->Release();
\endcode

The advantage of using the allocator instead of creating committed resource, and
the main purpose of this library, is that it can decide to allocate bigger memory
heap internally using `ID3D12Device::CreateHeap` and place multiple resources in
it, at different offsets, using `ID3D12Device::CreatePlacedResource`. The library
manages its own collection of allocated memory blocks (heaps) and remembers which
parts of them are occupied and which parts are free to be used for new resources.

It is important to remember that resources created as placed don't have their memory
initialized to zeros, but may contain garbage data, so they need to be fully initialized
before usage, e.g. using Clear (`ClearRenderTargetView`), Discard (`DiscardResource`),
or copy (`CopyResource`).

The library also automatically handles resource heap tier.
When `D3D12_FEATURE_DATA_D3D12_OPTIONS::ResourceHeapTier` equals `D3D12_RESOURCE_HEAP_TIER_1`,
resources of 3 types: buffers, textures that are render targets or depth-stencil,
and other textures must be kept in separate heaps. When `D3D12_RESOURCE_HEAP_TIER_2`,
they can be kept together. By using this library, you don't need to handle this
manually.


\section quick_start_mapping_memory Mapping memory

The process of getting regular CPU-side pointer to the memory of a resource in
Direct3D is called "mapping". There are rules and restrictions to this process,
as described in D3D12 documentation of [ID3D12Resource::Map method](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12resource-map).

Mapping happens on the level of particular resources, not entire memory heaps,
and so it is out of scope of this library. Just as the linked documentation says:

- Returned pointer refers to data of particular subresource, not entire memory heap.
- You can map same resource multiple times. It is ref-counted internally.
- Mapping is thread-safe.
- Unmapping is not required before resource destruction.
- Unmapping may not be required before using written data - some heap types on
  some platforms support resources persistently mapped.

When using this library, you can map and use your resources normally without
considering whether they are created as committed resources or placed resources in one large heap.

Example for buffer created and filled in `UPLOAD` heap type:

\code
const UINT64 bufSize = 65536;
const float* bufData = (...);

D3D12_RESOURCE_DESC resourceDesc = {};
resourceDesc.Dimension = D3D12_RESOURCE_DIMENSION_BUFFER;
resourceDesc.Alignment = 0;
resourceDesc.Width = bufSize;
resourceDesc.Height = 1;
resourceDesc.DepthOrArraySize = 1;
resourceDesc.MipLevels = 1;
resourceDesc.Format = DXGI_FORMAT_UNKNOWN;
resourceDesc.SampleDesc.Count = 1;
resourceDesc.SampleDesc.Quality = 0;
resourceDesc.Layout = D3D12_TEXTURE_LAYOUT_ROW_MAJOR;
resourceDesc.Flags = D3D12_RESOURCE_FLAG_NONE;

D3D12MA::ALLOCATION_DESC allocationDesc = {};
allocationDesc.HeapType = D3D12_HEAP_TYPE_UPLOAD;

D3D12Resource* resource;
D3D12MA::Allocation* allocation;
HRESULT hr = allocator->CreateResource(
	&allocationDesc,
	&resourceDesc,
	D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_GENERIC_READ,
	NULL,
	&allocation,
	IID_PPV_ARGS(&resource));

void* mappedPtr;
hr = resource->Map(0, NULL, &mappedPtr);

memcpy(mappedPtr, bufData, bufSize);

resource->Unmap(0, NULL);
\endcode


\page reserving_memory Reserving minimum amount of memory

The library automatically allocates and frees memory heaps.
It also applies some hysteresis so that it doesn't allocate and free entire heap
when you repeatedly create and release a single resource.
However, if you want to make sure certain number of bytes is always allocated as heaps in a specific pool,
you can use functions designed for this purpose:

- For default heaps use D3D12MA::Allocator::SetDefaultHeapMinBytes.
- For custom heaps use D3D12MA::Pool::SetMinBytes.

Default is 0. You can change this parameter any time.
Setting it to higher value may cause new heaps to be allocated.
If this allocation fails, the function returns appropriate error code, but the parameter remains set to the new value.
Setting it to lower value may cause some empty heaps to be released.

You can always call D3D12MA::Allocator::SetDefaultHeapMinBytes for 3 sets of heap flags separately:
`D3D12_HEAP_FLAG_ALLOW_ONLY_BUFFERS`, `D3D12_HEAP_FLAG_ALLOW_ONLY_NON_RT_DS_TEXTURES`, `D3D12_HEAP_FLAG_ALLOW_ONLY_RT_DS_TEXTURES`.
When ResourceHeapTier = 2, so that all types of resourced are kept together,
these 3 values as simply summed up to calculate minimum amount of bytes for default pool with certain heap type.
Alternatively, when ResourceHeapTier = 2, you can call this function with
`D3D12_HEAP_FLAG_ALLOW_ALL_BUFFERS_AND_TEXTURES` = 0. This will set a single value for the default pool and
will override the sum of those three.

Reservation of minimum number of bytes interacts correctly with
D3D12MA::POOL_DESC::MinBlockCount and D3D12MA::POOL_DESC::MaxBlockCount.
For example, free blocks (heaps) of a custom pool will be released only when
their number doesn't fall below `MinBlockCount` and their sum size doesn't fall below `MinBytes`.

Some restrictions apply:

- Setting `MinBytes` doesn't interact with memory budget. The allocator tries
  to create additional heaps when necessary without checking if they will exceed the budget.
- Resources created as committed don't count into the number of bytes compared with `MinBytes` set.
  Only placed resources are considered.


\page configuration Configuration

Please check file `D3D12MemAlloc.cpp` lines between "Configuration Begin" and
"Configuration End" to find macros that you can define to change the behavior of
the library, primarily for debugging purposes.

\section custom_memory_allocator Custom CPU memory allocator

If you use custom allocator for CPU memory rather than default C++ operator `new`
and `delete` or `malloc` and `free` functions, you can make this library using
your allocator as well by filling structure D3D12MA::ALLOCATION_CALLBACKS and
passing it as optional member D3D12MA::ALLOCATOR_DESC::pAllocationCallbacks.
Functions pointed there will be used by the library to make any CPU-side
allocations. Example:

\code
#include <malloc.h>

void* CustomAllocate(size_t Size, size_t Alignment, void* pUserData)
{
	void* memory = _aligned_malloc(Size, Alignment);
	// Your extra bookkeeping here...
	return memory;
}

void CustomFree(void* pMemory, void* pUserData)
{
	// Your extra bookkeeping here...
	_aligned_free(pMemory);
}

(...)

D3D12MA::ALLOCATION_CALLBACKS allocationCallbacks = {};
allocationCallbacks.pAllocate = &CustomAllocate;
allocationCallbacks.pFree = &CustomFree;

D3D12MA::ALLOCATOR_DESC allocatorDesc = {};
allocatorDesc.pDevice = device;
allocatorDesc.pAdapter = adapter;
allocatorDesc.pAllocationCallbacks = &allocationCallbacks;

D3D12MA::Allocator* allocator;
HRESULT hr = D3D12MA::CreateAllocator(&allocatorDesc, &allocator);
\endcode


\page general_considerations General considerations

\section general_considerations_thread_safety Thread safety

- The library has no global state, so separate D3D12MA::Allocator objects can be used independently.
  In typical applications there should be no need to create multiple such objects though - one per `ID3D12Device` is enough.
- All calls to methods of D3D12MA::Allocator class are safe to be made from multiple
  threads simultaneously because they are synchronized internally when needed.
- When the allocator is created with D3D12MA::ALLOCATOR_FLAG_SINGLETHREADED,
  calls to methods of D3D12MA::Allocator class must be made from a single thread or synchronized by the user.
  Using this flag may improve performance.

\section general_considerations_future_plans Future plans

Features planned for future releases:

Near future: feature parity with [Vulkan Memory Allocator](https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/VulkanMemoryAllocator/), including:

- Alternative allocation algorithms: linear allocator, buddy allocator
- Support for priorities using `ID3D12Device1::SetResidencyPriority`

Later:

- Memory defragmentation
- Support for multi-GPU (multi-adapter)

\section general_considerations_features_not_supported Features not supported

Features deliberately excluded from the scope of this library:

- Descriptor allocation. Although also called "heaps", objects that represent
  descriptors are separate part of the D3D12 API from buffers and textures.
- Support for `D3D12_HEAP_TYPE_CUSTOM`. Only the default heap types are supported:
  `UPLOAD`, `DEFAULT`, `READBACK`.
- Support for reserved (tiled) resources. We don't recommend using them.
- Support for `ID3D12Device::Evict` and `MakeResident`. We don't recommend using them.
- Handling CPU memory allocation failures. When dynamically creating small C++
  objects in CPU memory (not the GPU memory), allocation failures are not
  handled gracefully, because that would complicate code significantly and
  is usually not needed in desktop PC applications anyway.
  Success of an allocation is just checked with an assert.
- Code free of any compiler warnings - especially those that would require complicating the code
  just to please the compiler complaining about unused parameters, variables, or expressions being
  constant in Relese configuration, e.g. because they are only used inside an assert.
- This is a C++ library.
  Bindings or ports to any other programming languages are welcomed as external projects and
  are not going to be included into this repository.
