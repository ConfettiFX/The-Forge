You can also find a chm file in the doc directory.

If the content is blank when trying to view the chm file,
you may need to unblock it:
1. Right-click on the .chm file and select "Properties".
2. In the resulting "Properties" dialog, click the "Unblock"
   button near the bottom of the "General" tab, and then click OK.
