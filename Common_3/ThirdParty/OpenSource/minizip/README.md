## History

Minizip was originally developed by [Gilles Vollant](https://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/minizip.html) in 1998. It was first included in the zlib distribution as an additional code contribution starting in zlib 1.1.2. Since that time, it has been continually improved upon and contributed to by many people. The original [project](https://github.com/madler/zlib/tree/master/contrib/minizip) can still be found in the zlib distribution that is maintained by Mark Adler.

The motivation behind this repository has been the need for new features and bug fixes to the original library which had
not been maintained for a long period of time. The code has been largely refactored and rewritten in order to help improve maintainability and readability. A compatibility layer has been provided for consumers of the original minizip library.

## Features

+ Creating and extracting zip archives.
+ Adding and removing entries from zip archives.
+ Read and write raw zip entry data.
+ Reading and writing zip archives from memory.
+ Zlib, BZIP2, LZMA, XZ, and ZSTD compression methods.
+ Password protection through Traditional PKWARE and [WinZIP AES](https://www.winzip.com/aes_info.htm) encryption.
+ Buffered streaming for improved I/O performance.
+ NTFS timestamp support for UTC last modified, last accessed, and creation dates.
+ Disk split support for splitting zip archives into multiple files.
+ Preservation of file attributes across file systems.
+ Follow and store symbolic links.
+ Unicode filename support through UTF-8 encoding.
+ Legacy character encoding support CP437, CP932, CP936, CP950.
+ Turn off compilation of compression, decompression, or encryption.
+ Windows (Win32 & WinRT), macOS and Linux platform support.
+ Streaming interface for easy implementation of additional platforms.
+ Support for Apple's compression library ZLIB and XZ implementations.
+ Zero out local file header information.
+ Zip/unzip of central directory to reduce size.
+ Ability to generate and verify CMS signature for each entry.
+ Recover the central directory if it is corrupt or missing.
+ Example minizip command line tool.

## Build

To generate project files for your platform:

1. [Download and install](https://cmake.org/install/) cmake (version 3.11 or later recommended).
2. Run cmake in the minizip directory.

```
cmake . -DMZ_BUILD_TEST=ON
cmake --build .
```

## Third-Party Libraries

Third-party libraries may be required based on the CMake options selected. If the system already has the library
installed then it will be used, otherwise CMake will retrieve the source code for the library from its official git repository and compile it in when the `MZ_FETCH_LIBS` option is enabled.
