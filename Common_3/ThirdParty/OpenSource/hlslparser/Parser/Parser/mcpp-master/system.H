/*
 * The variable 'mcpp_mode' specifies the mode of preprocessing as one of
 *          OLD_PREP, KR, STD, or POST_STD.
 *      Those modes have many differences each other --
 *          i.e. handling of translation phases; handling of some
 *          preprocessing tokens; availability of some directives; way of
 *          macro expansion;
 *          -- as follows.
 *
 * KR       Actual arguments of a macro are expanded (after substitution)
 *          with rest of the replacement text and the subsequent source text.
 *      ## in macro definition has no significance to cpp.  The surrounding
 *          tokens are macro-expanded separately.  Also, # has no significance
 *          to cpp.  The following token is expanded.
 *      Directly or intermediately recursive macro call causes an error.
 *      <backslash><newline> sequence is deleted only in string literals
 *          and in #define directive lines.
 *      sizeof (type) can be used in #if line.
 *      KR corresponds to the "K&R 1st."
 *
 * OLD_PREP     In addition to the KR specifications, this mode has the
 *          following characteristics (and some others).
 *      Converts comment to 0 space instead of 1 space.
 *      Expands the parameter like spelling in string literal as a macro.
 *      Does not check unmatched pair of '"' or '\''.
 *      OLD_PREP corresponts to "Reiser model" cpp.
 *
 * STD      Standard conforming mode.
 *      <backslash><newline> sequence is always deleted after trigraph
 *          conversion and before tokenization.
 *      Digraph sequences are recognized as tokens.
 *      Actual arguments of a macro are expanded separately prior to
 *          re-scanning of the replacement text.
 *      The name in the replacement text once expanded is not re-expanded,
 *          thus preventing recursive death.
 *      ## in macro definition concatenates tokens.  The tokens are not
 *          expanded.  The concatenated token is expanded by rescanning.
 *      # in macro definition stringizes the following argument.  The argument
 *          is not expanded.  \ is inserted before " and \ in or surrounding
 *          the string literal or character constant.
 *      An expanded macro is surrounded by spaces to prevent unintended
 *          token merging.
 *
 * POST_STD     This mode simplifies the behavior of STD mode as follows.
 *      1. Digraph sequences are converted in translation phase 1, as
 *          alternate characters rather than as tokens.
 *      2. A space is inserted as a token separator between any tokens in
 *          a source (except a macro name and the next '(' in macro
 *          definition): thus simplifying tokenization, test of macro
 *          redefinition and macro expansion, especially "stringization".
 *      3. Test of macro redefinition ignores difference of parameter names,
 *          test of which has little utility and not a little overhead.
 *      4. #if expression forbids character constants, which have little
 *          portability, little utility and not a little overhead.
 *      5. Rescanning of a macro expansion is limited in the replacement
 *          text, rest of the source file is not scanned, thus making the
 *          syntax of "function-like" macro call more similar to that of
 *          function call.
 *      6. Argument of #include directive in <header.h> form is an obsolescent
 *          feature.
 *      7. '$' or so are not treated specially in #define directive.
 *      8. Trigraphs, UCN (universal-character name) are not recognized.
 *      9. Multi-byte characters in an identifier are not recognized.
 *
 * The following specifications are available when mode is STD or POST_STD.
 *      preprocessing number token, digraphs,
 *      #pragma (#pragma MCPP put_defines, #pragma MCPP warning
 *          , #pragma MCPP debug) directive,
 *      #error directive,
 *      #if defined operator, #elif directive,
 *      predefined macros __FILE__, __LINE__, __DATE__, __TIME__
 *          , __STDC__, __STDC_VERSION__, __STDC_HOSTED__,
 *      wide character constant, wide character string literal,
 *      _Pragma() operator, variable-arguments macro,
 *      macro as an argument of #include, #line directives,
 *      escape sequences \x[hex-digits], \a, \v,
 *      '+' option (C++ preprocessing),
 *      'S<n>' option (re-defines __STDC__ as <n>, unpredefine some macros),
 *      'V<n>' option (re-defines __STDC_VERSION__ or __cplusplus as <n>),
 *      'h<n>' option (re-defines __STDC_HOSTED__ as <n>).
 * The following specifications are available only in STD mode.
 *      Trigraphs and UCN,
 *      Multi-byte characters in an identifier.
 * The following specifications are available only in KR and OLD_PREP modes.
 *      #assert, #asm, #endasm, #put_defines, #debug and some other older
 *          directives,
 *      argument of #line directive other than decimal-digits.

 * Translation limits.

 *
 * NWORK        Output buffer size.  Set this size according to your compiler-

 *              - 1.
 *              Nevertheless, when COMPILER == GNUC || COMPILER == MSC, mcpp
 *              uses NMACWORK as output buffer size because GNUC and Visual C
 *              can accept very long line.
 * NBUFF        Input buffer size after line concatenation by <backslash>
 *              <newline>.
 * NMACWORK     Internal work buffer size for macro definition and expansion.
 * IDMAX        The longest identifier length.
 * NMACPARS     The maximum number of #define parameters.
 *              NOTE: Must be NMACPARS <= UCHARMAX.
 * NEXP         The maximum nesting depth of #if expressions.
 * BLK_NEST     The number of nested #if's permitted.
 * INCLUDE_NEST The maximum nesting depth of #include.  This is needed to
 *              prevent infinite recursive inclusion.
 * RESCAN_LIMIT The maximum rescan times of macro expansion in STD or POST_STD
 *              modes.
 * PRESTD_RESCAN_LIMIT  The maximum rescan times of macro expansion in KR or
 *              OLD_PREP modes..
 *
 * NBUFF should not be smaller than NWORK.
 * NMACWORK should not be smaller than NWORK * 2.
 *
 * SBSIZE defines the number of hash-table slots for the macro symbol table.
 * It must be a power of 2.
 *
 * MKDEP_INIT   The initial maximum number of filenames in a dependency line
 *              of output of -M* option.  The maximum number is dynamically
 *              enlarged in execution.
