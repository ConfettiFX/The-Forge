Steps to setup android environment in Visual Studio

1)Using Visual Studio Installer install "Mobile Development with C++". 
We don't need NDK that comes with this packages so that can be unchecked.

2) Download latest NDK. -- https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads

3) Add NDK path in Visual Studio (Tools->Options->Android).


Steps if You want to creat a new Project(--there are quite a few steps but we got you covered :) )
1) Create A new Native-Activity Application for apk or Satitc Library if you want to build a library.

2) 
- copy all the includes from pch.h to android_native_app_glue.c and add #include <malloc.h>
- Delete pch.h and main.cpp 
- unselect the Use precompiled header files option from project property.

3) Since we need to add UserMacros  
-> CustomSysroot ->  $(VS_NdkRoot)\sysroot
-> TRIPLE  : Refer the table below for values

For respective architecture we insert the corresponding triple value in the macro(we only support ARM and ARM64)
Arch		Triple
ARM		arm-linux-androideabi
ARM64		aarch64-linux-android
MIPS		mipsel-linux-android
MIPS64		mips64el-linux-android
x86		i686-linux-android
x86_64		x86_64-linux-android


You can either add property sheets given by us which are included in Android_VisualStudio2017 folder, to your project's current target by selecting Add existing property sheet.
or create your own and just add those two Macros.

4) add path to include directories and uncheck inherit from parents
$(CustomSysroot)\usr\include
$(CustomSysroot)\usr\include\$(TRIPLE)
$(VS_Ndkroot)\sources\android\native_app_glue

5)add path to library 
$(SolutionDir)$(Platform)\$(Configuration)\ (this is where we have all our libs. set it accordingly)
$(VS_Ndkroot)\sources\third_party\shaderc\libs\c++_static\$(TargetArchAbi)

6)add path to executable directory and uncheck inherit from parent
$(VS_NdkRoot)\toolchains\llvm\prebuilt\windows-x86_64\bin

Notes:
Add -lm to you project Linker Command Line options for if you get any undefined math  operations error

If you get error related to "cannot use 'throw' with exceptions disabled"
- Enable exceptions in C++ Project settings

If you get error related to multiple instances of ioctl 
 add BIONIC_IOCTL_NO_SIGNEDNESS_OVERLOAD in preprocessor definitions
 
 If you get errors related to neon supprt not enabled
 -Enable Advance SIMD to Yes
 -Set floating point ABI to softfp
