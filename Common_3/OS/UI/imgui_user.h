// Returns 0 if no change
// Returns 1 if it got changed via the UI or the default textbox
// Returns 2,3,4,5 if a textbox was requested by double clik or crtl+click but wasn't spawned.
// The return value is based on which component asked for a text box since this is a multi-component widget.
/* Paramters:
	* label -> Name above widgets
	* value_p -> float value(s) to modify
	* components -> Number of values in value_p
	* minv -> min float value. If minv == maxv then no limits are applied
	* max -> max float value. Same as above.
	* format -> format to print the float value as. (Mainly used to control number of decimal points)
	* minimumHitRadius -> Determines what's the minimum hit radius for the knob to start rotating and change the value. 
	* windowWidthRatio -> [0,FLT_MAX] value that determines the final size of the all the knobs on the same line with respect to the containing window.
	                        Value of 1.0f with component = 1 --> Size of 1 knob takes full width  .. with 2 knobs and value of 1 --> each knob is half width and so on.
	* doubleTapForText -> If true then double clicking on knob will open a text box
	* spawnText -> 
	*     If true and doubleTapForText is true then the widget spawn a textu box instead of the knob widget.
	*     If false and doubleTapForText is true, then function will return an int between 2 and 5 to determine which component of the float value needs to be modified BUT the text box won't be spawned. It's up to the client to spawn it.
	 * framePaddingScale -> Multipler to control extra padding on left side of first knob
