The following software may be included in this product: libjpeg-turbo. This software contains the following license and notice below:

Copyright (C)2009-2014 D. R. Commander.  All Rights Reserved.

Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:

- Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.

- Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.

- Neither the name of the libjpeg-turbo Project nor the names of its contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.

THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS IS", AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS OR CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.
 

libjpeg-turbo is covered by three compatible BSD-style licenses:

1. The IJG license, which is described in README. This license applies to the libjpeg API library and associated programs (basically everything we borrowed from IJG.)

2. The libjpeg-turbo license, which is described in README-turbo.txt. This is a standard 3-clause BSD-style license, and it applies to the TurboJPEG API library and associated programs.

3. The libjpeg/SIMD license, which is described in simd/jsimdext.inc. This license is a subset of the other two, and it applies to the libjpeg-turbo SIMD extensions.

Roll-up of Licensing Terms

1. If you are distributing a modified version of the libjpeg-turbo source, then you cannot alter or remove any existing copyright or license notices.

 Origin: Clause 1 of the IJG and libjpeg-turbo licenses, Clauses 1 and 3 of the libjpeg/SIMD license

2. If you are distributing a modified version of the libjpeg-turbo source, then you must add your own copyright notice to the header of each source file you modified, so others can tell that you modified that file (if there is not an existing copyright header in that file, then you can simply add a notice stating that you modified the file.)

 Origin: Clause 1 of the IJG license, Clause 2 of the libjpeg/SIMD license

3. If you are distributing a modified version of the libjpeg-turbo source, then you must include the README file from IJG, and you must not alter any of the copyright or license text in that file.

 Origin: Clause 1 of the IJG license

4. If you are distributing only libjpeg-turbo binaries without the source, or if you are distributing an application that statically links with libjpeg-turbo, then your product documentation must include a message stating that "this software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group".

 Origin: Clause 2 of the IJG license

5. If your binary-only distribution or statically-linked application includes/uses the TurboJPEG API, then your product documentation must include the text of the libjpeg-turbo license.

 Origin: Clause 2 of the libjpeg-turbo license

6. You cannot use the name of the IJG or The libjpeg-turbo Project or the contributors thereof in advertising, publicity, etc.

 Origin: IJG license, Clause 3 of the libjpeg-turbo license

7. The IJG and The libjpeg-turbo Project do not warrant the software to be free of defects, nor do we accept any liability for undesirable consequences resulting from your use of the software.

 Origin: IJG license, libjpeg-turbo license, libjpeg/SIMD license

The following software may be included in this product: libjpeg. This software contains the following license and notice below:

The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied, with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose. This software is provided "AS IS", and you, its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.

This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane. All Rights Reserved except as specified below.

Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these conditions: (1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation. (2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group". (3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.

These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code, not just to the unmodified library. If you use our work, you ought to acknowledge us.

Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from it. This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's software".

We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are assumed by the product vendor.

The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf. It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable. The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub, ltconfig, ltmain.sh). Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.

It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Hence arithmetic coding cannot legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses. For this reason, support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software. (Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.) So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining code.

The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files. To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce "uncompressed GIFs". This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard GIF decoders.

We are required to state that "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of CompuServe Incorporated. GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of CompuServe Incorporated."
