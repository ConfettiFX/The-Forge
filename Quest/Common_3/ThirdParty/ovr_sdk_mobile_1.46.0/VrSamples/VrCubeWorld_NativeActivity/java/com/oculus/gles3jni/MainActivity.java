/**
 * When using NativeActivity, we currently need to handle loading of dependent shared libraries
 * manually before a shared library that depends on them is loaded, since there is not currently a
 * way to specify a shared library dependency for NativeActivity via the manifest meta-data.
 *
 * <p>The simplest method for doing so is to subclass NativeActivity with an empty activity that
 * calls System.loadLibrary on the dependent libraries, which is unfortunate when the goal is to
 * write a pure native C/C++ only Android activity.
 *
 * <p>A native-code only solution is to load the dependent libraries dynamically using dlopen().
 * However, there are a few considerations, see:
 * https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/android-ndk/l2E2qh17Q6I/wj6s_6HSjaYJ
 *
 * <p>1. Only call dlopen() if you're sure it will succeed as the bionic dynamic linker will
 * remember if dlopen failed and will not re-try a dlopen on the same lib a second time.
 *
 * <p>2. Must remember what libraries have already been loaded to avoid infinitely looping when
 * libraries have circular dependencies.
